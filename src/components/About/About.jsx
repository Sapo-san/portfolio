            Here&apos;s a list of things I&apos;ve worked at as a freelancer. Most of them are landing pages with a contact form for small businesses.
          </p>
          <p>
            The list is not that long since I actually found a fulltime job and I don&apos;t have much time to freelance on the side

          <h2>Other Experiences:</h2>
          <p>
            I was part of the Teaching assistant team for Computer&apos;s Architecture course back in uni.
            I worked as Lab and Classes asisstant for five semesters (2019 - 2021), mainly grading student&apos;s tests,
            doing Lab lectures and helping them both in person and remotely. We worked with Vivado Software, the Basys3 Artix-7 FPGA and VHDL.
          </p>
          <p>
            Last but not least and also while in uni, I volunteered for a while as betatester
            for <a href="https://www.moddb.com/mods/swgl"> Star Wars Galactic legacy </a>,
            a fanmade expansion for a Star Wars PC Videogame. 
            I had to find bugs in the mod and report them to the modding team so they could be
            fixed ASAP. It was a short but VERY rewarding experience since I love the game
            and the community is very welcoming and dedicated to the mod.
